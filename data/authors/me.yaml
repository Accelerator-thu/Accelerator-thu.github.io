bio: |
  Hi! I'm Yufan Cao and I'm a second-year Ph.D. student in EECS at UC Berkeley (BAIR). I'm fortunate to be supervised by Professor [Yun S. Song](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~yss/). 
  
  I work on computational biology, genomic sequence modeling, and DL-based generative and evolutionary models. I'm interested in building AI systems that help us understand the natural world and improve human lives 🧬🤖
  
  Feel free to reach out for a coffee chat - I really love coffee ☕️
